# Bluff-Detector-with-Regression-Models
Here, in this small project, a dataset containing various position and salaries of those positions of a company has been taken, and a bluff detector has been created using various regression models, which can detect or predict any salary at any position of the company. 
I have predicted for the position 7.5, but for any position-salary prediction this detector can be used. 
The X value can be anything, for larger dataset also this detector works.
