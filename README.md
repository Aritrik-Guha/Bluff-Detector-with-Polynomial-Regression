# Bluff-Detector-with-Polynomial-Regression
A polynomial regression is a special form of linear regression. It can be used for avoiding outliers in dataset and misfit of data while visualizing and also to avoid wrong prediction and results. Here, in this small project, a dataset containing various position and salaries of those positions of a company has been taken, and a bluff detector has been created using polynomial regression, which can detect or predict any salary at any position of the company. 
I have predicted for the position 7.5, but for any position-salary prediction this detector can be used. 
The X value can be anything, for larger dataset also this detector works.
